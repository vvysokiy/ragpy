Fyodor Dostoevsky explored the depths of the human soul in his works. In *Crime and Punishment*, he depicted the inner struggle of the protagonist between morality and the desire to justify a crime for the sake of an idea. His writing had a tremendous impact on world literature and the philosophy of the 20th century.  

Fyodor Dostoevsky laid the foundation of the modern psychological novel and profoundly influenced world literature and 20th-century philosophy by delving into the depths of the human soul and the inner conflicts of his characters, especially in *Crime and Punishment*.  

The inner conflict of Raskolnikov  
The main character of *Crime and Punishment*, Rodion Raskolnikov, is constantly torn between an inhuman theory of the “right of the strong,” which allows one to justify a crime for the sake of an idea, and his own conscience, humanity, and compassion. His struggle is a clash between love for people and contempt for the “crowd,” a desperate attempt to prove his own superiority, which ultimately ends with moral awakening and repentance.  

Themes and philosophy of Dostoevsky  
In his works, Dostoevsky raised philosophical questions of morality, free will, the nature of evil, faith, and doubt, showing that every human being is a mystery, the central problem of existence, and that life itself is an endless trial of the spirit. He masterfully demonstrated polyphony, giving voice to different ideas and types of personality, and created the archetype of the “hero of a higher idea.”  

Influence on world literature and philosophy  
Dostoevsky influenced key figures of world culture: his works are seen as a precursor of existentialism, and his ideas were studied and developed by 20th-century philosophers such as Nietzsche, Sartre, and Camus, as well as psychologists and writers. European and American authors borrowed from him not only techniques of depicting the inner world but also themes of spiritual quest and personal freedom.  

Innovation and contribution  
He was the first to depict “borderline” and extreme states of the human psyche, far ahead of the emergence of psychoanalysis and the technique of “stream of consciousness.” Dostoevsky’s works remain relevant because they address eternal questions about the meaning of life, the cost of moral choice, the value of each human being, and the possibility of redemption.
