Russian poetry of the Silver Age truly opened new artistic horizons, reflecting the drama of the time and the personal upheavals of poets, while also marking the shift toward modernism and the avant-garde in Russian culture.  

Characteristic features of the era  
The Silver Age (late 19th — early decades of the 20th century) was marked by the search for new forms and meanings, combining multiple literary movements — from Symbolism to Futurism and Acmeism. Poetry of this time was characterized by an interest in philosophy, psychology, mysticism, a heightened intellectualism, and a drive for aesthetic experimentation.  

Main movements  
- Symbolism (Blok): subtext and ambiguity, the art of suggestion.  
- Acmeism (Akhmatova): poetic concreteness, the “beautiful clarity.”  
- Futurism (Mayakovsky): experimentation with language, a break with tradition.  
- Beyond schools (Tsvetaeva): an individual style, profound emotionality.  

The contribution of Akhmatova, Blok, Mayakovsky, Tsvetaeva  
- Akhmatova combined Acmeist clarity with the depth of personal drama.  
- Blok, inspired by Symbolism, spoke in the prophetic imagery of his time.  
- Mayakovsky, as an avant-gardist, created a fundamentally new poetic language and rhythm.  
- Tsvetaeva worked outside rigid schools, filling poetry with tragic sincerity and rich metaphor.  

Transition to modernism and the avant-garde  
The Silver Age is closely tied to the rise of modernism (a new artistic mindset, a break with classical forms) and the development of avant-garde movements, combining a striving toward the future with the reflection of social catastrophes of the era. It was a time of unprecedented freedom of artistic expression and the breaking of old canons in the search for authentic meaning.
